# _Ocean_ `🌊`
## software system that provides interactive environmental simulation
***
__Preys `🐟`, predators `🦈` , obstacles `🌿` fill the ocean.__

#### Preys (`🐟`) at each iteration random move in ocean.

#### Predators (`🦈`) eat nearby prey or move

#### All fish have a life cycle (all fish have time to live and to breed)
#### depending on the settings, the process proceeds differently
#### the process ends when one of the species is extinct, or all iterations have completed
#### number of iterations and setting of input parameters in the module settings.py
